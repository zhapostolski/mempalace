        wing: Optional wing filter.
        room: Optional room filter.
        source_file: Optional exact source_file filter. Matches the full
            stored source_file value verbatim (#1815).
        n_results: Max results to return.
        max_distance: Max cosine distance threshold. The palace collection uses
            cosine distance (hnsw:space=cosine) — 0 = identical, 2 = opposite.
            Results with distance > this value are filtered out. A value of
            0.0 disables filtering. Typical useful range: 0.3–1.0.
        vector_disabled: When True, route to the sqlite-only BM25 fallback
            (#1222). Set by the MCP server when the HNSW capacity probe
            detects a divergence that would segfault chromadb on segment

              ``n_results * 3`` rows from the vector index are the rerank pool.
              Cheap; works well when query and target docs agree in the

              through the backend's ``lexical_search`` capability and merge
              them into the rerank pool (deduped by source_file). Catches docs

              characterized.

              When ``max_distance > 0.0`` is also set, BM25-only candidates

# Virtual line numbering — read-time grid for drawers (3.3.6).

# Drawers are stored verbatim on disk. The reader applies a line-number grid
# at read time so any drawer — numbered or not — can be sectioned by a closet
# pointer like ``→2026-01-18:L55-L72`` without rewriting the corpus. Pure
# functions, no I/O. Source drawer text is never mutated.
# See docs/virtual-line-numbering.md for the full design rationale.
